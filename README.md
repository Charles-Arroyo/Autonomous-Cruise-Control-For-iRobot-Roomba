Project Description:
Driving is an essential part of daily life for millions of people, but the monotony and fatigue associated with extended drives pose significant challenges to comfort and safety. Traditional cruise control systems have limitations in adapting to changing traffic conditions and individual driver preferences, especially for elderly drivers and those with disabilities. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system that provides a seamless and responsive driving experience tailored to the unique needs of all drivers.

Problem Statement:
Drivers universally encounter sensations of fatigue and monotony while driving, which can compromise comfort and safety. Traditional cruise control systems fail to adapt to real-time traffic dynamics and individual preferences, creating a gap in the driving experience. This gap is particularly pronounced for elderly drivers and individuals with disabilities, who face distinct challenges in using traditional cruise control systems. Thus, there is a pressing need for an enhanced ACC system that addresses these challenges and elevates the driving experience for all.

Functional Requirements:
Utilize IR and Ping sensors to record information about surroundings.
Use bumper sensor to avoid obstacles.
Display important data to the driver via an LCD screen.
Move to the destination while avoiding changes in elevation (holes) and remaining within specified paths and boundaries.
Provide data to remote display (Putty).
Support both manual and autonomous modes.
Avoid obstacles within specified distances and paths.
Prototype:
Our CyBot vehicle will feature two operating modes: manual and automatic. In manual mode, the user controls the vehicle's movements and is responsible for avoiding obstacles. In automatic mode, all features related to ACC are activated, and the vehicle performs a surrounding scan before continuing its path to the destination.

Demonstration Narrative:
Imagine traveling home after a long day, encountering various challenges such as construction sites, pedestrians crossing the road, and emergency vehicles speeding by. Our enhanced ACC system ensures a seamless driving experience by adapting to these changing conditions, ultimately enhancing comfort and safety for all drivers.
